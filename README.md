# unity-ecosystem-simulation
## What is this?
This is a fun little project meant to simulate an ecosystem on a procedurally generated terrain using the Unity game engine.

## What's the purpose of this?
It was mainly a learning experience for me, however, despite it being a fairly simple simulation,
its still pretty fun to follow each individual animal and watch how even this basic simulation
mimics the fundamentals of real ecosystems (relation between prey and predator populations, etc.)

## How can I play and check this out?
There's a download link here -> <add link later>

## What are the current main issues?
1. NavAgent movement is very unnatural and rough when there are many NavAgents in the simulation due to them taking a long time to calculate their path. 
	Possible solutions include either starting calculating their next path while they're still moving or creating my own pathfinding system.
2. The ecosystem better at balancing/self-balancing - It's decent as it is right now, however there's a lot of room for improvement.
