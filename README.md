# unity-ecosystem-simulation
## What is this?
This is a fun little project meant to simulate an ecosystem using the Unity game engine.

## What's the purpose of this?
It was mainly a learning experience for me, however, despite it being a fairly simple simulation,
its still pretty fun to follow each individual animal and watch how even this basic simulation
mimics the fundamentals of real ecosystems (relation between prey and predator populations, etc.)

## How can I play and chcek this out?
There's a download link here -> <add link later>
