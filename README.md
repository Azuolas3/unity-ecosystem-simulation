# unity-ecosystem-simulation
## What is this?
Project meant to simulate a basic ecosystem on a procedurally generated terrain using the Unity game engine.

## What's the purpose of this?
It was mainly a learning experience for me, however, despite it being a fairly simple simulation,
it's still pretty fun to follow each individual animal and watch how even this basic simulation
mimics the fundamentals of real ecosystems (relation between prey and predator populations, etc.)

## How to setup this project?
Just clone it and launch from unity!
